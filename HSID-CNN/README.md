This code is for academic purpose only. Not for commercial/industrial activities.




**NOTE:**

This Matlab version is a re-implementation with ***HSID-CNN*** (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454887, IEEE TGRS, 2019), and is for the ease of understanding the algorithm. This code is not optimized, and the speed is not representative. The result can be slightly different from the paper due to transferring across platforms.



**Enviroment:**

     Window 7, Cuda 7.5, Caffe framework (**Necessary, GPU mode better**), Matlab R2014b. 
     Place set this folder into "($Caffe_Dir)/examples/"
